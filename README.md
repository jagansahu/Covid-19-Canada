## Covid-19 Canada

Group project for HackInstead. Group members: Jagan, Chien, Abhinav and Feng.

### Purpose of this Project

Even though there are already many websites that provide information about Covid-19 stats, either officially built or personally built. But they are not oriented around how the situation is in Canada, which means it takes some efforts for us Canadians to find Covid-19 status of Canada. So, we chose to built Covid-19 Canada to help Canadians to instantly access to such info with just one click.

### What This App Actually Does

1. Allows users to select a specific region in Canada and see how many people have been infected and died due to Covid-19
2. Allows users to see cumulative graphs of how number of people being infected and died in past 10 to 50 days. Users are able to choose how many days they want to see.
